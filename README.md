Retrofit
Retrofit turns the HTTP API into java interface.
It makes it relatively easy to retrieve and upload JSON (or other structured data) via a REST based webservice.

To use it, there are three classes needed,
1. Model class which is used as a JSON model
2. Interfaces that define the possible HTTP operations
3. Retrofit.Builder class - Instance which uses the interface
and the Builder API to allow defining the URL end point for the HTTP operations.

Every method of an interface represents one possible API call. It must have a HTTP annotation (GET, POST, etc.) to specify the request type and the relative URL. The return value wraps the response in a Call object with the type of the expected result.

@GET("getUser")
    Call<UserDataModel> displayUser(@Header("Authorization") String token);
  
You can use replacement blocks and query parameters to adjust the URL. A replacement block is added to the relative URL with {}. With the help of the @Path annotation on the method parameter, the value of that parameter is bound to the specific replacement block.

  @PUT("addToCart/{id}")
    Call<HomeContentModel> addCart(@Path("id") int id, @Header("Authorization") String token);
  
The @Body annotation on a method parameter tells Retrofit to use the object as the request body for the call.

   @POST("/registration")
    Call<SignupResponse> registerUser(@Body UserModel userModel);
